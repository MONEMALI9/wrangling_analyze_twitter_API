The dataset that was wrangled ( and analyzed and visualized ) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates , also known as WeRateDogs . WeRate Dogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog . These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators , though ? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10 , 12/10 , 13/10 , etc. Why ? Because \" they're good dogs Brent . \" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage . The entirety of this project was completed inside the Udacity classroom on the Project Workspace . However , the reports were created and exported as HTMLs using Jupyter Notebook ."
